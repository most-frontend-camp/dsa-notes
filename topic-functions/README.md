### Rest and spread

Although both operators in JavaScript have identical syntax, i.e., three dots (â€¦), these operators are not the same and perform different tasks.

The main difference between the two operators lies in their names. The spread operator in JavaScript expands values in arrays and strings into individual elements whereas, the rest operator, puts the values of user-specified data into a JavaScript array.
