# Problem Solving 

### Goals

* Define what an algorithm is
* Devise a plan to solve algorithms
* Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

HOW DO YOU IMPROVE?
1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem solving patterns

PROBLEM SOLVING
